welcome to the blog. my boyfriend was cool and talented enough to make (!) this whole blog for me which is crazy but he continues to amaze me. thanks babe love you! anyways. i was unsure about what to write about first but i think that i'll just write about something that i think is suitable for my first blog post: beginnings and how they can be both scary and exciting.

obviously, as you're first beginning something it can feel so scary since you're basically diving headfirst into something relatively new to you. whether it's a job, a sport, or just a hobby, they all carry that same anxiety and almost dread: dread about the seemingly inevitable failure that you will face. well hi, i'm liz and things that i start, i never finish for the same reasons that i just listed. i'm so afraid of failure and new things. however, i start them while thinking about the positive outcome. i just don't think about what comes in between; how hard you have to work to reach your goal or how it's inevitable to fail. but what differenciates what you're meant to do to what i do is that you have to try again and again, until you accomplish what you wanted to do. i do not.

that's something that i've been meaning to get better at. it's quite possibly one of my worst character traits. my mom has always said that no one likes a quitter and although she mostly says that to urge me to *quit* quitting, she does have a point. it's not that no one will like you, but more that you seem unpassionate. sort of like a blob, but that's a bit much. i'm sure that you understand what i mean. although it's not beneficial to think about how others percieve you, it's still food for thought.

but why listen to me? i'm just a hypocrite, after all. i have a small list of things that i've started that i never followed through with:

1. piano, quit after six years
2. swim, quit after five years
3. guitar, quit after a month (it's still in the corner of my room)
4. cross country, two seasons and i was out!
5. crocheting, still a w.i.p. (i'm saying that, but i haven't touched it in weeks)

so it could be better, but it could be worse. so anyways, why should you take any of my words into consideration? i can't even follow my own advice. you, as the reader, should because chances are, you've been feeling uninspired to continue with something. chances are, you're thinking of giving up. but take it from me, it's not worth it. sure, the relief you feel after it is like none other but the guilt that you'll feel stays. like "damn, why couldn't i just suck it up? i could have been so good by now!" or "i wish i kept doing ___, it would have helped me so much." you see what i'm saying? in the end, the only person you're hurting is yourself. clich√© or whatever, but i couldn't care less. bottom line is: keep going! i really don't care if you're whining and are like "but liz! it's sooo hard and i'm so tired of it and there's no point!" and if you are, consider this: what made you start it in the first place? why did you decide to put your time into it? what was your end goal and is it still worth it? (the answer is yes.)

i actually, believe it or not, am attempting to better myself and rid of this malpractice. tomorrow is my second day at the gym. i'm going to get back into shape (praise the lord) and go consistently. that means commitment. i'm going to be honest, i'm pretty nervous. today was a hard day, it being the first day back and all. but i don't want to give up. i want to go and i want to feel good about having a consistent hobby in my life. i also want to make gains and work glutes but that's a whole different story. point is, if i can try, so can you. but if i do end up quitting the gym then i'm going to delete this blog post and you can just disregard everything i'm saying. but i have a good feeling about this. partially because i'm going to be going with my friend, phoebe. i wouldn't leave her to work out by herself so that's another thing that motivates me. 

even when it gets hard, you need to find motivation. whether it works your mind and helps your intelligence or it keeps you in shape, there is always something. it could be that doing this will help your chances with someone, it doesn't matter. **there is always something.** wow the bold is so fun lolz. sorry, moving on, you just have to find motivation and as aforementioned, remember what made you start in the first place. stopping when it gets hard is one of the worst things that you can do, take it from me.

but if it's just too rigorous and you can't handle it or if you don't really have time for it, that's perfectly okay. you shouldn't feel compelled to continue with something simply because you started it. if you started it and you realized that it wasn't the thing for you, i'm positive that there are other things. but in this post i was mainly emphasizing on when you started something and feel the urge to give up simply because it's getting hard.

this was a very long post and i'm very sorry - i didn't realize i was this passionate about the topic but apparently i am. maybe i have a career in philosophy!
