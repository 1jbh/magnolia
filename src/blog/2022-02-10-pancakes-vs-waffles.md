hi, today i would like to talk about pancakes. i love pancakes. they might be my favorite breakfast food. but waffles might be tied.

buttermilk pancakes are the most delicious thing you could eat. and BLUEBERRY buttermilk pancakes???? sooooo good. chocolate chip pancakes are pretty good too. but when i eat pancakes with fruit in them or with them i feel so good about myself. chocolate chip pancakes make me feel so warm and happy though.

waffles are so tasty as well. chicken and waffles? best thing ever. especially with maple syrup. i cant pretend to be a maple syrup expert though - ive only had plain maple syrup, not any of those fancy flavored maple syrup. im almost afraid to try it though, i love the normal maple so i dont want to taint my view of it.

but which is better..pancakes or waffles? to be completely honest, ive never arrived at a clear decision on this matter. pancakes are so easy to make but waffles are easier. you dont have to flip waffles, you just pour the batter into a waffle maker and you have waffles! flipping pancakes can be tricky business but its doable. even by me, a terrible cook. both go amazingly well with maple syrup, obviously. both are holdable and very transportable. both can have that incredible fluffiness but ive found that making waffles fluffy is actually harder than making pancakes fluffy, although i wouldnt be surprised if i was proven wrong. im so conflicted. right now, i rather have chicken and waffles. but pancakes are amazing too...my conclusion is that both are very close but waffles are the best for me. the syrup can sit in the little grid pattern thing and be sooo yummy and you can put anything in waffles (like pancakes) but waffles hold better and the grid thing is cute and CHICKEN AND WAFFLES EXIST!

food is so yummy

im going to go make pancakes in a bit
