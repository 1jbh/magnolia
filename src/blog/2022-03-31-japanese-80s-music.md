hi! japanese 80's pop. arguably one of the best music genres ever. it makes me want to dance and sing and go 60 in a 40 mph zone. (please don't attempt)

i've heard so few people talk about it so here i am, ready to share my unwanted opinion! soooo why do i like it? well for starters, it has an amazing beat. you could professional dance to this. but don't fact check me. it also always has an incredible bass line. if that means nothing to you, i will explain it simply. low noise in the song makes the song weeeee. yes. and to further prove my point, SAX SOLO. god, saxophones in songs are so good. it's such an easy way to elevate a song. i love it. and last but definitely not least THE VOCALS!!!! there's just something about them and how soulful they are that makes them different than the typical songs we hear on the radio now.

here are some of my favorites:

1. hiroshi satoh - this boy <-- this is an album

2. tanako mamiya - love trip <-- also an album!

3. junko yagami - bay city

4. junko ohashi - telephone number

5. mariya takeuchi - plastic love

6. miki matsubara - stay with me

7. tatsuro yamashita - magic ways <-- favorite FAVORITE <3

these songs are all very good. i love themmm have funnn
