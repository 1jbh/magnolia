consistency is something that i always strive to have. i'm so obsessed with the idea of being consistent. like being a regular somewhere, having a usual order, being in consistent relationships in your life, you get the point. i want to be someone that has something, like oh, at this place i always get *this* and *this*. and while i do really want to be like this, i kind of already am.

ry tells me how i'm a very predictable person. i don't know if that's just because he knows me so well or if i actually am. i do stick to a pretty solid routine but i don't know honestly. even if i am predictable, it's not the kind of consistency that i'm looking for. what i'm looking for is being recognizable. not recognizable in a way that's like "oh, i remember her" but rather like "oh, liz, she always gets a chai tea latte with oat milk". that is what i mean. i just want to like have an order to be able to rely on because i know that it's amazing.

and as aforementioned, i want consistency in my relationships. when i say relationships i'm referring to both platonic and romantic. my relationship is honestly very stable, i never worry about it and it's always just there and so is my boyfriend and it's great. i just got lucky i guess, because i know that that is definitely not the case with a lot of other people, my friends rant about guys to me all the time because i am supposedly the "most stable one" or whatever (definitely not). i do try to help my friends the best i can though obviously. speaking of friendships, most of my friendships are all very secure and i love that. if i have a toxic friendship i try to drift away as quickly as i can because i've learned my lesson about those. but yeah, i'm trying a lot to make sure that my life is filled with consistency.

now is when where i make it even more about me!!! let's talk my regular orders. no matter what, at chick fil a, i always get their chicken cool wrap, a medium fries, a water bottle and chick fil a sauce. it's so good. BUT MY FAVORITE REGULAR ORDER IS DEFINITELY MY COFFEE ORDER. I ALWAYS GET CHAI LATTE WITH OAT MILK AND I SWEAR BY IT. it makes me feel so boujee and cool and hot. so californian. i have more regular orders but those are the most important.

this post had absolutely no purpose but i just wanted to write about it.
