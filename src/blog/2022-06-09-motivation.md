i struggle with motivation but especially during the end of the school year, when i can clearly see the last day of school. i have probably like four-ish days of school left so i feel like it is only natural that i really don't want to do anything remotely related to school. i have a test tomorrow, along with two projects next week and two finals and i haven't started preparation for any of them. it isn't because i just don't care about doing well, it's because i have such a lack of motivation right now.

the only reasonable explanation that i could think of is that summer break is so soon and so i don't really have any urgency to finish the tasks. but now that i think about it, i feel like that would add to the urgency. but i feel absolutely done with school. however, these things do need to get done in a timely manner and i've figured out how to accomplish that.

i've found that when i feel good, i also feel good about making an effort to be productive. when i'm not productive, i often feel bad about myself and in general. it's sort of like a sick cycle. i don't feel great, i don't do my work. i don't do my work, i don't feel great. and so on and so on.

so in order to break that cycle, you have to make the first effort to either do your work, or make yourself feel good about yourself. it's honestly a lot harder than most people give it credit for and the hardest part of this whole ordeal. once you get started, it's so much easier than it might've originally felt. you just have to make the effort to break that cycle.

breaking the cycle not only improves your life, but also your entire lifestyle. you'll find your mindset and the way that you live your life vastly improving.

i did this and now i find myself knitting, crocheting, reading, improving my grades, welcoming new friendships, and overall becoming a better person. when i look at myself in the mirror i'm no longer greeted by disgust anymore. i am actually okay with who i see now.

when you feel good, everything in your life improves. surround yourself in positivity and negative thoughts will become more scarce. now i have to go do my homework! not looking forward to that, but the most difficult part is starting it.
